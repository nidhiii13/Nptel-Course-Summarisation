# Nptel-Course-Summarisation

The scope of the project is to build a Deep Learning based solution that generates an Extractive and Abstractive Text summary of chapter-wise/lecture-wise content available in NPTEL course videos. The Abstractive output will be treated as Candidate summaries. The summary is generated from the transcripts extracted through web scraping.
